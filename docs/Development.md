There are currently three versions of Explorama
- bundles/browser
- bundles/electron
- bundles/server

### General Prequisites
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)
- [Java](https://adoptium.net/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Make
- [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) - just for some tools

### Browser
The browser version is the easiest to develop for. Just run `make dev` and open the `localhost:4000` file in your browser.

> [!IMPORTANT]

> Currently you have to use:
```
npx shadow-cljs build
vite build --mode development
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```

### Electron
The electron version is a bit more complicated. You need to run `make dev` and `make dev-app` in two different terminals. Then you can open the electron app.

### Server
The server version simply does not work at the moment.

### Folder structure
There are currently three places where you can find code:

#### Plugins
The plugins are shared code between all versions and are separated into backend and frontend code. There are also some tests ðŸ¥¸.

#### Bundles

Bundles are containing the specific code for each version of Explorama.

#### Libs

Libs are also shared code like plugins but are more libary like. We will see how to deal with them later.

#### Tools

Additional tooling for development.

#### Styles

Repoistory for the stylesheets and images.
