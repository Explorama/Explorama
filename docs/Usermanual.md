Explorama is a user-friendly data analytics tool designed specifically for subject matter experts and individuals without in-depth technical knowledge. It empowers users to effortlessly analyze and visualize their data, turning raw numbers into meaningful insights without the need for complicated software or coding expertise.
Navigation
You can open windows on the workspace by clicking on the tool-icons on the left. Windows can be arranged by drag&drop on the colored header. You can move on the workspace by drag&drop on the right mouse button (default setting). You can connect windows by dragging one on the other, like this you can connect a search to a mosaic window for example. When windows are connected, they share the same header color.

The search is your main tool to select relevant data for you. Choose attributes on the left side and characteristics on the right. When you selected your database, click on search. You can always change your search selections and update the search with a click on search, connected windows are then updated. If you want to filter only one visualization window use the filter in the tool bar of that window <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/filter.svg" height="15" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);">.

## <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/mosaic2.svg" height="20" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);">  Mosaic
Mosaic works with tiles (single data points) as the smallest level of information, these tiles are linked via attributes (time, location, organizations, etc.). This unique visualization enables a quick overview and in-depth exploration through groupings, color coding, timelines and much more. Mosaic enables both quantitative and qualitative analyses.
* Use in the grid view grouping, subgrouping, sorting, sorting of groups to understand your data.
* The scatterplot view shows the data along two configurable axes.
* In the tree map view you can see and analyze the group and subgroup distribution especially well. Choose between 3 tree map types.

You can always change the coloring in the legend under layouts. Click on the pen (edit) to choose another layout via “+ Add layout” or change the one you are using with another click on edit. 

Single tiles can be commented and copied.
## <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/map.svg" height="20" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> Map
For geographic analyses the map offers different base maps, layouts and overlayers.
When you connected a search with data to a map you can see clusters and markers (single data points). Markers are summarized by clusters, when you click on a cluster or zoom in more markers will be shown. With a click on a marker you can see some details, defined in the layout. 
Legend
* General: Change the base map in the legend via the pen (edit) next to general. Here you can also choose shapes, if shapefiles are imported, these can be dots, lines, areas etc. You can also switch from clusters to only single markers (if you are below a certain data size)
* Layouts: Change the layout of the markers via the pen (edit) next to layouts. You can choose another layout or change the existing one.
* Overlayer: You can add overlayers, which display aggregated

## <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/charts.svg" height="20" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> Chart
For aggregated visualisations you can choose from a variety of charts.
* Line Chart
* Bar Chart
* Scatterplot (points are aggregated)
* Pie chart
* Bubble chart
* Wordcloud

It is possible to change the axis attributes, the aggregation of the attributes, the axis height and compare different characteristics over show by. You can also compare data via the selection of two charts, in which you can choose different chart types to differentiate the data.

## <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/table.svg" height="20" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> Table
You can find a classic data representation in the table.
## <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/head-cogs.svg" height="20" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);" > Prediction
Look into the future with a few clicks. Drag a search selection onto the prediction window, choose your time horizon and click on predict. The result is shown below. With a click on the coloured header you find more information about the algorithm and model metrics.
## <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/note.svg" height="20" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> Notes
In notes you can add hints, titles, summaries in a project. Use the multiple text editor functions. With a click into the note you can edit the text, with a click outside, you can move the note.
## Projects
Create projects via the <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/save.svg" height="15" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> save icon. Everything you do in a project is automatically saved (also the closing of windows). If you want to start a new anaylsis use the X (Clean), afterwards you can open your project again over the project overview <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/folder-open.svg" height="15" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> or on the welcome page. 

## <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/download.svg" height="20" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> Export
You can export the visualizations, dashboards, reports and workspace as PNG and PDF.

## Dashboards & Reports 
Easily create dynamic dashboards and reports for at-a-glance overviews over the <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/reporting.svg" height="15" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> dashboard & report icon on the top right.
* Dashboards: Click on + create Dashboard, choose a layout, drag visualization windows over the header into the fields of the layout, give a title and an optional subtitle and save.
* Reports: Click on + create Report, add as many rows and visualization windows over drag&drop into the rows as you want, add text into the rows via doubleclick into a field, use the text editor functions, give a title and an optional subtitle and save.

## <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/atlas.svg" height="20" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> Data atlas
In the data atlas you can understand the relations between datasources, attributes and characteristics. By clicking on an element, the other columns are filtered for connected datasources/attributes/characteristics.
## <img src="../styles/src/img/svg/indicator.svg" height="20" style="filter: invert(28%) sepia(9%) saturate(1798%) hue-rotate(181deg) brightness(95%) contrast(91%);"> Indicator creator
In the indicator creator you can create new attributes, combine different datasources and calculate specific aggregations.
## Importer
Start the importer via the welcome page or over the user icon on the top right and then Export/Import data. Add a CSV-file, check the automatically generated mapping and import. After some time you can use the data in the search. Hint difference between "facts" and "contexts": Contexts are attributes with a smaller number of repeatedly occurring values like countries, categories, etc. Properties can have values specific for a data point like numeric values or title (an infinite number of values are possible). Contexts can be grouped and sorted, properties can only be sorted.
