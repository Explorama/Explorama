## Development

### Setup

1. Install [Grunt's CLI](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started) globally.
2. Change to this project's root directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install this project's dependencies.
4. Run `grunt init` to initialize your local repository.
5. Run `grunt` to start the web server and start developing!

All necessary files are automatically built in the `dist` directory when developing with the web server running.
If you simply want to build based on the current source files, run `grunt build`.
